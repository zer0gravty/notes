JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
<script src="filepath, abs or rel">Script can go here if not srced from somewhere</script> NOTE: type="text/javascript"
no longer required with HTML5 as JavaScript is the default script; however you can change if not using JavaScript?"

    Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
        To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
        The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
    Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
        For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write()
        Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
            document.write(3-1);
    Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
        Doesn't alter the html of the page or code in anyway.
            window.alert(5 + 6);
    Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
        Obviously, won't print to the screen of the user directly. Will need to open the console mode in the browser. (F12)
            console.log(5 + 6)
